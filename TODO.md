## 🎯 Next Session

### Remaining Cleanup
- [ ] **Bug #7**: Remove unused variables (low priority cleanup)

### Medium Priority Improvements
- [ ] **Core #5**: Session state management - Don't reparse on every render
- [ ] **Core #2**: Display all parsed fields - Many fields parsed but not shown in UI
- [ ] **Core #3**: Data validation - Add bounds checking for parsed values
- [ ] **Core #4**: Empty data handling - Better messages when sections have no data

### Polish & UX Improvements
- [ ] **Polish #1**: Add loading states with spinners during parsing
- [ ] **Polish #2**: Color coding for performance thresholds
- [ ] **Polish #3**: Chart improvements (tooltips, better colors, downloadable images)
- [ ] **Polish #7**: Time formatting consistency (use _format_time() everywhere)
- [ ] **Polish #8**: Units consistency (standardize MB vs GB display)

### Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Polish #9**: Performance metrics dashboard with bottleneck analysis
- [ ] **Polish #5**: Log comparison mode (upload two logs, show diff)
- [ ] **Polish #11**: Historical tracking (store previous renders)
- [ ] **Polish #12**: Smart optimization suggestions based on patterns

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple logs
- [ ] Permalink/sharing functionality
- [ ] Arnold version detection and warnings
- [ ] Search and filter within logs
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Export parsed data to JSON/CSV
